# hibang
A target application from which we will derive the curriculum for the Hibernate/Angular/Spring Boot/postgresql class.

## To Use:

1. Clone it.
2. Run the `create_and_import` script in the `sql` subdiretory.
3. In order, run in three Terminal windows:
   * `mvn spring-boot:run` in the `ui` subdirectory.
   * `mvn spring-boot:run` in the `auth` subdirectory.
   * `mvn spring-boot:run` in the `resources` subdirectory.

Go to [http://localhost:8080] and enjoy!
